# Student-Performance-Prediction-streamlit
This Streamlit web application predicts a student's performance score based on several input features. Users can enter their study hours per week, attendance percentage, mental health score, sleep hours, and part-time job status. The app applies a pre-trained machine learning model to estimate the student's performance score out of 100.
